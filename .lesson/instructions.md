# Instructions

Use media queries to control precisely how the grid items
rearrange as the window shrinks. When the window size
is below 600px, every card should be on its own row.
When the window size is above 600px but below 1000px,
there should be two cards on each row. Finally, when
the window size is above 1000px, all four cards should
be on the same row.

Remember that media queries are made like this:
```
@media (property: triggerValue) {

}
```

Whenever the property value reaches the `triggerValue`, the code
inside the curly braces is run.
